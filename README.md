The New York City (NYC) Airbnb dataset provides a comprehensive collection of information about short-term rental listings within the city, as listed on the Airbnb platform. It offers insights into the diverse accommodations available to travelers and provides a valuable resource for understanding the trends, preferences, and dynamics of the NYC lodging market. The dataset includes several columns that capture various aspects of the listings, hosts, and guests:

1) id: A unique identifier for each listing.
2) name: The name or title of the listing.
3) host_id: A unique identifier for the host of the listing.
4) host_name: The name of the host.
5) neighbourhood_group: The borough of the listing (e.g., Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island).
6) neighbourhood: The specific neighborhood within the borough.
7) latitude: The latitude coordinate of the listing's location.
8) longitude: The longitude coordinate of the listing's location.
9) room_type: The type of room available (e.g., Entire home/apt, Private room, Shared room).
10) price: The nightly price for renting the listing.
11) minimum_nights: The minimum number of nights required for booking.
12) number_of_reviews: The total number of reviews received for the listing.
13) last_review: The date of the last review.
14) reviews_per_month: The average number of reviews per month.
15) calculated_host_listings_count: The number of listings managed by the host.
16) availability_365: The number of days the listing is available for booking in the next 365 days.

The dataset offers insights into the geographical distribution of listings across neighborhoods and boroughs, the types of rooms available, pricing trends, and host and guest behaviors. It enables users to analyze popular neighborhoods, compare room types, visualize price distributions, and uncover patterns in review activity.
